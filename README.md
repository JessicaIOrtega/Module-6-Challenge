# Module-6-Challenge
Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description
This is challenge 6 for the UTA Bootcamp (Module 6) where we were asked to use the 5 Day Weather Forecast API to retrieve weather data for cities. In this app you can see the actual weather as well as the next 5 days.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Great to use when traveling for a few days to another city and you need to know how the weather is going to be for the next 5 days.
Is simple and yet gives you all the information needed!
